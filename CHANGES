0.99-1.0.0rc1 - 2004-06-23 jw

 Enhancements:

  . Changed default value of AAClockSkew to 0. This parameter will now
    need to be explicitly set on web servers that are not NTP
    synchronised.

  . Added new config directive AALogLevel to set the minimum logging
    level for this module. Revised logging levels so that, at the
    default AALogLevel setting (warn), the module is normally
    silent. Revised many log messages (todo15,18)

  . Added new config directive AAForceInteract. If set to 'On', all
    requests to the authentication server (for initial or repeat
    authentication) will require the user to enter their
    password. This overrides the authentication server's 'single
    sign-on' capability, and may provide increased security at the
    cost of decreased convenience. (todo#7, suggested by Paul Warner)

  . Added new confg directive AAInactivityTimeout. When not 0 (the
    default) this implements an addition authentication timeout based
    on user inactivity, in addition to the 'hard' timeout controlled by
    AAMaxSessionTimeout (todo#6, suggested by Paul Warner)

  . Added new confg directive AACacheControl, possible values 'Off',
    'On', 'Paranoid'. When 'On' (the default) the module adds minimal
    cache control response headers to discourage caching of content in
    shared proxy caches. 'Paranoid' causes additional headers to be
    sent, 'Off' suppresses this behaviour (todo#14)

  . Added a special content handler that can be used via 'SetHandler
    AALogout' to automatically create a 'logout URL'. Added new
    directives AALogoutMsg so the content of the default page can be
    overridden, and AALogoutService to set the location of the
    authentication service logout page that is linked to from the
    default logout page (todo#13)

  . AAFail directive now takes the standard values 'On' or 'Off'

  . Overhauled the directive merging process. The values of all
    directives used this module are now inherited from outer blocks.

  . Added module version stamp to Apache startup banner, and to
    'Server:' HTTP response header (subject to the setting of the
    ServerTokens directive)

  . Session cookie now contains issue data and lifetime, rather than
    issue date and expiry date

  . Assorted code changes to better support building Apache 1.3 and
    Apache 2 modules from the same source 

  . Assorted changes to better support Apache 2

  . Updated documentation

 Bugs fixed:

  . Fixed a bug that could cause a successfully initial
    authentication to be immediately followed by a re-authentication
    request claiming 'You login to the site has expired' (todo#9
    reported by Martin Lucas-Smith)

  . Re-worked how we determine our own URL - it should now never use
    information provided in the request (such as the 'Host:' header)
    and therefore be safe even if 'UseCannonicalName' is off (todo#4)

  . Changed most error returns to be '400 - Bad Request', '500 -
    Server Error' now used only for server configuration errors
    (todo#12, suggested by Ben Harris)

  . Corrected a bug which caused only the first 4 characters of
    AACookieKey to be used (toto#17)

  . Corrected potential bug in encoding/decoding base64 data
    containing NULL 

  . Stopped sending 'skew' parameter in requests, since it's about to
    become deprecated in the protocol, and improved log messages that
    may result from out-of-sync clocks (todo#11)

  . Fix a bug that would have prevented successfully authentication of
    requests containing CGI parameters

  . Added check for a '401 - Access Denied' ErrorDocument before
    inserting the module's default page (the latter needed because the
    Apache default is confusing in a mod_ucam_webauth context).

0.45 - 2004-06-11 jw

0.44 - 2004-05-04 jw

  . Fixed to build for gcc 2.?? (as found on RH7.2 etc) - source

    statement in the source
